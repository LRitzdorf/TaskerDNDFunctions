Do Not Disturb-related functionality for Tasker

__:warning: NOTE: This repo is currently empty. It will contain a Tasker profile XML file very soon.__


## Functions
These are the various DND-related functions that this Tasker project contains.

### Auto DND (Profile)
Description

### Reload DND (Task)
Description

#### :heavy_check_mark: Activation
To use this function, go to: `Settings > Preferences > Action [tab]`. Under `Quick Settings Tasks`, on any line (I recommend using the second one), tap the magnifying glass and choose the `Reload DND` task. Hit the `Back` arrow.

Open Quick Settings (swipe down from the top of your screen with two fingers) and hit the pencil icon (or whichever "edit" icon your Android version uses). Scroll down to the "Drag to add tiles" section. Tap and hold the `Reload DND` icon, and drag it up into your Quick Settings. Rearrange as desired.

### Volume Button Toggle (Profile)
Description

### Smartwatch-volume Toggle (Profile)
Toggles DND when you hit either volume-adjustment button on your smartwatch. Default configuration works with Garmin devices.
